# hello-word

In this page I should introuduce something about myselfï¼Œ
but I prefer making myself as what I want to be rater than just discribing what I did.

In my opinon what I'm is almostly nothing about what I think, 
I am make of feelings in differant moments.

Strange to say I always do thinking, espically about almostly everyone's problems.
If I got something useful I will share them here.

Today I want to share kind of feeling part,
one sentence I saw on a shirt yesterday.
It's say
"Treatured who cares you and loves you, 
since you may lose the moon when you you counting stars."

I won't. I won't do the things I regret.
I know in the Asian culture that couldn't happen,
but we can try to and finally nail it.

Hope we all can be a person like that.
